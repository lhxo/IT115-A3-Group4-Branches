0. Once upon a time...
1. There was a skeleton bear named Boogie.
2. Boogie has a kitty friend named Roammy.
3. Roammy wasn't afraid of Boogie like the others.
4. In exchange, Boogie let Roammy ride on his back. 
5. It was warm and cozy up there.
6. The two climbed up the spiraling mountain.
7. Time went by, Boogie and Roammy started to feel hungry.
8. So, they ventured to a nearby river in search of fish.
9. After a couple of hours they caught several fish. 
10. Their scales gleamed in the moonlight. 
11. The two set up camp and sizzled the fish they caught.

16. And they lived happily ever after.
